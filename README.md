# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The predictive model provides actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.  

## Features  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Identifies customers likely to churn based on historical data.  
- **Business Value**: Supports proactive decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## Dataset  
The project uses a synthetic telecom dataset with features like:  
- Customer demographics  
- Subscription details  
- Usage patterns  
- Customer support interactions  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.  
   - Normalized numerical features for uniform scaling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:    
   - Analyzed correlations among key features.  
3. **Model Building**:  
   - Built and trained machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
   - **Gradient Boosting**: Used to improve model performance by combining weak learners to create a robust predictive model.  
   - Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning.  
4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Key Result  
- Achieved high prediction accuracy and improved decision-making capabilities for churn management.
